Welcome to the Lavender Soft developer blog! We are just starting development on a new roguelike. The working title is ECO, but that will almost certainly change.

Not much has happened so far. A few nights ago we had our initial design session. During that session we hammered out our theme, realistic suburban forest; our protagonist, various animals through the progression system; and our leveling mechanics, mainly centered around food.

Other than that, we have begun work on the engine, but mainly that has consisted of following the libtcod tutorial for Python and playing around with a few map generating algorithms in a simple sandbox.

By coincidence, we happen to be making this game in line with [/r/RoguelikeDev's 2020 tutorial jam](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/grccvt/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/), though our decision to make a game together was mainly driven by both of us buying Caves of Qud.

Before the week is out, we will have another blog update with some pictures of the engine in progress and some more details about our design.
